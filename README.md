# CLUBBER

Based on a real life problem faced by many clubs at UBC that is 
managing their list of club members, their roles , tasks assigned
contact information and what are the upcoming events. These all can 
be done on a single platform now. Also track the list of 
sponsors as well as who has paid the membership fees and much more.

This can be easily optimized to be used by clubs and I view this in a future as a system where all the members
are on a single platform and take quick decisions. This can 
also be used as a tool for marketing about their clubs and adding new people as you go by.
